Summary:

Advances in computer technology and developments in
software design and implementation open possibilities
of predicting properties and structures of larger 
molecules and clusters using methods of quantum chemistry 
with accuracy which matches that of experimental procedures 
at much lower cost.
This request for a hardware grant is aimed to provide a
scalable high-performance computing and code development
platform for an international team of collaborators  performing 
large scale chemical modeling calculations on the interactions of
nucleic acids and protein fragments.
The team of researchers includes theoreticians and experimentalists
drawn from  faculty, staff, and students from five countries.
It is proposed that the hardware obtained for this project
will be maintained and supported by the Department of Chemistry, 
University of Arizona and accessed by the members of the 
research team via the Internet. 
The project will modify existing programs and develop new parallel
computational chemistry programs which by their nature are 
ideally suited for implementation on clusters of high performance
SMP/MPP nodes. The project should provide an excellent demonstration
of what can be achieved with this parallel architecture.
