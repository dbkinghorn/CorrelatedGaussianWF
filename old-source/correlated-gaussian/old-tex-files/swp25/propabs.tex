A new method is proposed for computing vibration-rotation spectra of
molecules. The method fully exploits the use of analytic matrix formulas for
integrals and derivatives of correlated Gaussian functions and is described
in three steps; 1) compute a potential energy surface using a correlated
Gaussian based variational calculation, for small systems (up to 8
electrons), or a CI approach for larger systems, 2) model the potential
energy surface using a series of elliptic correlated Gaussians, 3)
variationally solve the vibration-rotation problem using a basis of
rotationally adapted correlated Gaussians. The method is expected to produce
excellent results since all n-body interactions are correlated throughout
the procedure. Also, the method has the very desirable property that it can
be easily extended to systems much larger than those studied by other ab
initio methods.
