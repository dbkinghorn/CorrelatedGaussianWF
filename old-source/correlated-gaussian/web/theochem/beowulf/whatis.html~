What is a Beowulf
</h1>
<p>
<b>Here's one of many possible definitions:</b><br>
<hr>
<blockquote>
A Beowulf system is a collection of personal computers constructed from 
commodity-off-the-shelf hardware components interconnected with a system-area-network
and configured to operate as a single unit, parallel computing platform, using 
an open-source network operating system. 
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
A Beowulf is dedicated parallel cluster as opposed to a Network of Workstations (NOW)
or Cluster of Workstations (COW). A Beowulf is more like a Pile Of PC's (POP)
<p>
The driving design philosophy of a Beowulf system is to achieve 
the best possible price/performance ratio for a given computing problem.
For many problems it's possible to achieve an order of magnitude improvement
in price/performance compared with "conventional" parallel supercomputer
designs.
<p>
Currently the two <b>most common system designs</b> are;
<ul>
<li>Intel PII/III based PC's with switched fast ethernet running Linux</li>
<li>High performance Alpha processor based PC's with 
<a href="http://www.myri.com/">Myrinet</a>
(a high speed low latency network system) running Linux</li>
</ul>
The Intel+fast ethernet systems are very popular and offer good performance
for problems that have a high calculation/communication ratio (coarse grained). 
The Alpha + Myrinet based systems offer excellent performance competing 
head on with conventional ($expensive$) supercomputers. In fact 
<a href="http://www.hpti.com/Clusterweb/">HIGH PERFORMANCE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.</a>
was recently awarded a contract to build an Alpha + Myrinet Beowulf supercomputer
for NOAA's 
<a href="http://www.fsl.noaa.gov/">Forecast Systems Laboratory</a> (FSL) that is expected to eventually perform
four TeraFLOPS (four trillion arithmetic computations per second). 
See the <a href="http://www.hpti.com/">press release</a>.   
It's highly significant that they won this contract based on demonstrated 
performance while competing with the "heavy iron" supercomputer vendors. 
<p>
There are numerous <b>other possibilities</b>. Almost any hardware can be used, there is
even talk about using Sony-PlayStation2's running Linux to build Beowulfs! The new
<a href="http://www.amd.com">AMD Athlon</a> and soon to be released 
<a href="http://www.intel.com>Intel Merced</a>  offer other high performance
posibilites. Other networking technology such as ATM and GigaBit ethernet
can be used. Most anything is fair game. However, the most common, and thus
the most well understood, systems are Intel or Alpha + fast ethernet or Myrinet. 
<p>
For the <b>network operating system</b> Linux is by far the most popular for Beowulfs and 
it's largely the combination of the free availability of the Linux source code
coupled with low cost high performance PC components that has spawned the Beowulf
movement. 
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>
 would also a good choice. Also, people have used commercial operating
systems such as Sun Solaris and Microsoft Windows NT. However, the strongest support
and most rapid development is happening in the Linux community. Any 
<a href="http://www.Linuxberg.com/distribution.html">Linux distribution</a> can 
be used, the most popular are
<a href="http://www.redhat.com"> RedHat</a>, 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and 
<a href="http://www.SuSE.com/">SuSE</a>, with RedHat being the most
popular. [I use 
<a href="http://www.linux-mandrake.com/">Mandrake</a>
 which is based on RedHat but optimized for Pentium systems
and updated more frequently]

<a href="http://www.beowulf.org/listarchives/beowulf/">and the list archives</a></li>
<li>There is a useful book with lots of good information titled,
