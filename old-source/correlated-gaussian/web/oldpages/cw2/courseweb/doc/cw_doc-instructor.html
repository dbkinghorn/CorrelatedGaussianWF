on the student interface. Instructors can use these menu items by uploading
the appropriately named files to the server (view the default pages, they
contain the file naming information). Or the menu items can be removed
and new menu items and web pages can be added using the Instructor Interface

<P><IMG SRC="instructor-list.gif" HEIGHT=739 WIDTH=560></P>

<P><A NAME="instructor interface page"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>The Instructor
Interface</FONT></P>

<P>The Instructor Interface has four sections. The small top section is
the heart of the Instructor Interface. The three lower sections are the
<A HREF="cw_doc-student.html">Student Interface</A>. </P>

<P>The top section contains a menu with the <A HREF="#instructor interface functions">Instructor
Functions</A>. These functions allow the course instructor to build and
modify the menu list of the Student Interface, and upload web pages to
create and modify the content of the course website.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="instructor-site1.gif" HEIGHT=563 WIDTH=562></P>

<P><A NAME="instructor interface functions"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>Instructor
Interface Functions</FONT> - Menu and File Modification Controls</P>

<P>There are seven Functions available in the Instructor Interface. Each
of these functions are explained below.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="instructor-functions.gif" HEIGHT=407 WIDTH=547></P>

<P><A NAME="new announcement"></A><B>New Announcement - Add to the announcements
page </B></P>

<P>The new announcement function allows the instructor to quickly add comments
to the Announcements page of the course website. The Announcements page
is the initial page shown to the user when they enter the site. Announcements
are added at the &quot;top&quot; of the page and all privious announcements
can be reviewed by scrolling down the page.</P>

<P>As shown below the function requires a name in the &quot;From&quot;
box. If an email address is added in the e-mail box it will be converted
into a functional &quot;mailto&quot; which will allow netscape users to
send e-mail easily. The announcement box can contain any textual information.
If &quot;http://&quot; addresses are included in the announcement text
they will be added as active internet hyperlinks.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="addannounce.gif" HEIGHT=491 WIDTH=612></P>

<P><A NAME="delete announcement"></A><B>Delete Announcement - Delete from
the announcements page </B></P>

<P>The Delete Announcement function allows the Instructor to remove old
announcements. When announcements are removed the remaining announcements
are not renumbered.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="delannounce.gif" HEIGHT=331 WIDTH=512></P>

<P><A NAME="add link"></A><B>Add Link to Menu - Create New Menu Item, link
to existing web page </B></P>

<P>The Add Link to Menu function allows the Instructor to create a new
menu item on the Student Interface for the course and assign an &quot;http://&quot;
address (URL) to the new menu item. This is used to give students quick
access to an existing site on the web.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="addlink.gif" HEIGHT=371 WIDTH=572></P>

<P><A NAME="delete menu item"></A><B>Delete Menu Item - Remove Menu Item
from Student Interface </B></P>

<P>The Delete Menu Item function allows the instructor to remove items
from the Student Interface. The item to be removed is chosen from a drop-down
menu of the items in the Student Interface as shown below.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="delitem.gif" HEIGHT=331 WIDTH=512></P>

<P><A NAME="upload file"></A><B>Upload File - Upload files to server, Update
files on server</B> </P>

<P>The Upload File function allows the instructor to upload web page content
(html or graphics files) to the server. The pages can be added as new menu
items or added to the server without creating a new menu item on the Student
Interface.</P>

<P>This function can be used to &quot;update&quot; files which already
exist on the server. Uploaded files with the same name as files which exist
on the server will over-write the existing file. Any links to the existing
file will link the the latest uploaded copy.</P>

<P>This function can also be used to upload pages or graphics which are
referred to (&quot;linked&quot;) by other web pages. This feature requires
the instructor to understand and use hyperlink features of html documents
(This topic will not be addressed in this document. For assistance or pointers
to html classes and online tutorials see the <A HREF="http://www.chem.arizona.edu/developers/index.html">Chemistry
Department Web Developers Page</A>.)</P>

<P><IMG SRC="upload.gif" HEIGHT=411 WIDTH=623></P>

<P><A NAME="delete uploaded file"></A><B>Delete Uploaded File - Remove
file from server </B></P>

<P>The Delete Uploaded File function deletes files from the server. Only
files which have been uploaded using the Upload File function can be deleted
with this function.</P>
