To whom it may concern:

Please accept this letter as official notice of my intent to terminate my
position effective 1, June 1998. I have accepted a ``more'' permanent
position elsewhere. My decision to leave the University of Arkansas is not
based on any conflicts or dissatisfaction with the university, the chemistry
department, my advisor [Prof. Pulay] or any members of my working group. I
regret any inconvenience that my early departure may cause. I simply
received an ``offer I couldn't refuse''.
