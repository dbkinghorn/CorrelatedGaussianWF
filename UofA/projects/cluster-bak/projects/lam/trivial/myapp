# Wave1d sample application schema
# mpirun -v myapp

#
# Run exactly two processes.
# Assuming the multicomputer is homogeneous, ship the executable
# to each node.  This is slower but more convenient than placing it there
# yourself or relying upon NSF and your shell path to be right.
#
# We specify the full pathname to the "trivialc" executable so that it
# is sure to be found.  It may not be necessary to specify the full
# pathname in all cases; see mpirun(1) for more details.
#
# Any one line application schema can be done on the mpirun command line,
# without a schema file like this one.
