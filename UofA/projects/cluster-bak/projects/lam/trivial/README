trivial.c is a most basic message-passing program that transfers one
message between two processes.  Two versions are supplied: one in C
and the other in Fortran.

Use hcc to compile the C program.

hcc -o trivial trivial.c

Use hf77 to compile the Fortran program.

hf77 -o trivial trivial.f

ezstart.c is a master/slave skeleton used in "MPI Primer / Developing
With LAM".  See the Mandelbrot example for a more complete
master/slave program.
