\begin{letteropening}
Dear Prof. Light:
\end{letteropening}

I have made the corrections requested by the referee for the manuscript 
\textbf{A New N-Body Potential and Basis Set for Adiabatic and Non-Adiabatic
Variational Energy Calculations} by Donald B. Kinghorn and Ludwik Adamowicz.
My apologies for letting the paper out the door without proper proofing.
There were indeed many spelling and punctuation errors. I am returning the
original copy with errors marked and three copies of the corrected
manuscript.


I would prefer that the manuscript appear in the *** section.

Please keep one of the pre-prints for your own use (with my complements). I
am very excited about this new basis set and believe it will lead to
significant new results for both adiabatic and non-adiabatic calculations.
Unfortunately my post-doc funding ran out and I have taken a temporary job
writing web pages for the next six months (still at the U of A). I hope to
get back to work on the implementation of the basis set as soon as more
funding comes our way.
