<P><B>Research Associates:</B></P>

<P>Dr. <EM>Piotr Piecuch</EM>, recently appointed as an assistant professor at the Michigan State University, joined
us for one and a half year and worked on theoretical formulation and computational implementation of the fully-exponential
SSMRCC scheme and on developing improved methods for converging the CC amplitude equations; Dr. <EM>Keya Ghose</EM>,
after completing her Ph.D. degree with Prof.S.Pal in Puna, India, stayed for a year with my group and worked on
implementation of the recursively calculated intermediates and on the property calculations. She currently lives
in Delhi, India and works on a grant from the Indian Ministry of Sciences; Dr. <EM>Zdenek Slanina</EM>, now a professor
at the Laboratory of Molecular-Design Engineering, Toyohashi University of Technology, Japan, worked for a year
in our group on carbon clusters, fullerenes and related projects; Dr. <EM>Genady Gutsev</EM>, currently at Jackson
State University, spent two years in our group (first year of his stay was funded by a grant from the CAST program)
and did calculations on molecular and cluster anions; Dr. <EM>Don Kinghorn</EM>, who has just returned to my group
after a stay at the University of Arkansas with Prof. P. Pulay, had worked for one and a half years in my group
on implementations of explicitly correlated gaussian functions to non-BO atomic and molecular calculations and
to the general N-body vibrational problem and has just completed work on the key integral and gradient formulas
for the work presented here; Dr. <EM>Vladimir Ivanov</EM> from University of Kharkov, Kharkov, Ukraine, who has
join our group in November '98, has been working on implementation of the multireference coupled-cluster theory
based on the CASSCF reference wave function.</P>

<P><B>Graduate Students:</B></P>

<P>Dr. <EM>Nevin Oliphant</EM>, currently with a computer company serving the Wall Street Stock Exchange, made
a significant contribution to the conceptual framework of the SSMRCC theory and its implementation; Dr. <EM>Pawel
Kozlowski</EM>, currently a postdoctoral research associate with Prof. T. Spiro at Princeton University, developed
the non-BO approach to multi-body systems and implemented explicitly correlated gaussian functions to perform application
calculations for those systems; Mr. <EM>Z. (John) Zhang</EM> continued Pawel's work on correlated gaussians and
implemented analytical derivatives for optimization of the variational wave functions for atomic and molecular
systems. In this he has been helped by Mr. <EM>Eric Schwegler</EM> who, after completing his first year of the
graduate program at Arizona, transferred to the University of Minnesota; Mr. <EM>Yasser Elkadi</EM> has been working
on dipole-bound anionic states of molecules and cluster systems; Dr. <EM>William McCarthy</EM>, who graduated with
a Ph.D. in September 1996 and moved to the Utah State University to join Prof. S. Aust's group, developed methodology
for describing large-amplitude vibrations in larger molecular systems; Mr. <EM>Vadim Alexandrov</EM> has been working
on development of a wave-packet time-propagation method which will be applied to study intra- and inter-molecular
proton transfer reactions; Mr. <EM>Doug Gilmore</EM> before moving to Law School at Concorde, New Hampshire, developed
a technique for optimizing multi-center correlated gaussians based on analytical gradients; Ms. <EM>Dayle Smith</EM>
has studied intramolecular hydrogen-bonding systems involving DNA bases and electron attachment to these systems;
Ms. <EM>Sandra Blumhorst</EM> continued Gilmore's work for a year on implementation of explicitly correlated gaussians
to molecular problems before moving to another research group; Mr. <EM>Maurice Cafiero</EM> and Mr. <EM>Ismail
Al-Jihad</EM> are two talented and enthusiastic new graduate students who have joined group are eager to start
research.</P>

graduating from Rice, now works with Prof. B. Schlegel at Wayne State; Mr. <EM>Nathan Oyler</EM>, currently a graduate
student at the Department of Chemistry, University of Washington, investigated dipole-bound anionic states of nucleic
acid bases; and Ms. <EM>Melissa Farrow</EM> did some work on graphic interfaces of our programs; Mr. <EM>Chris
Tarsitano</EM> who is currently working in our group on three-body vibrational calculation using the methodology

<P>Drs. <EM>Ivan Ortega-Blake</EM> and <EM>Humberto Saint-Martin</EM> from UNAM at Cuernavaca, Mexico, visited
Arizona several times for short visits to work on the collaborative project funded by International Programs at
NSF; Dr. <EM>Maciej Nowak</EM> from the Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, visited my group for
a month to work on a review article describing our collaborative research on IR spectroscopy of the nucleic acid
bases and their analogs; Prof. <EM>Jong Lee</EM> from Chonbuk National University, South Korea, spent his sabbatical
year in my group working on electronic excitations of chain carbon clusters; Dr. <EM>Andrzej Les</EM> from the
