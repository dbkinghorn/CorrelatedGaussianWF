Notes for review of Analysis on the ... by Bao and Shi

1) use of "dipositroniums" should be replaced by dipositronium

2) there are many gramatical errors [the first sentence is particularly bad]

3) any reference to geometrical concepts for this system should note that it's B.O. perturbation strength is 1. Also, as reported in reference [2], uncertanties in position expectation values are of the same order of magnitude as the expectation values themselves.

4) comment should probably be made about the very short predicted lifetimes for this system
