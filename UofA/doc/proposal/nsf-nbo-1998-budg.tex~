We have two main budget needs in this project. First, we
need to provide summer salary support for the P.I.
and salaries 
for  the postdoctoral research associate
and 
for the graduate student
working on the project.
The proposed budget will provide two months of salary for the
P.I. and twelve months of salary for a 
postdoctoral research associate and a graduate student,
each year.


The second budget item is a purchase of an SGI ORIGIN 200
4-cpu system with 1GB RAM and 20 GB disk. This system 
will provide an excellent parallel environment for the 
proposed method development and application calculations.
At the price of \$30,554 this system is probably the best
buy at the present time. The SGI computer will complement
and eventually replace
our aging cluster of IBM RISK 6000 workstations.

The third budget need are the travel expenses and
operation funds for the project, including materials
and supplies, publication costs, computer services,
communication costs, {\it etc.}
We budgeted the minimum what will be needed for this 
purpose.
