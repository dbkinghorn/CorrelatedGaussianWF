%\opening{Hi}

The books listed below are essential references for the administration and programming of our newly acquired computing equipment. 
They were unfortunately not available through any stores vendors.

Administration and programming our computing equipment is a shared responsibility in our lab. Documentation and reference material is as important as the computing machinery itself for the work done in this lab.( Theoretical and Computational Chemistry )

Managing NFS and NIS: This is the essential reference for setting up and maintaining our NFS and NIS domain.

Managing Projects with Make: This is the principle source compilation and management tool used in this lab on our new systems.

Learning Perl: We are using Perl for scripting applications and process control. (I was fortunately able to find a used copy of this book at considerably reduced price)

It is my responsibility to train the researchers and graduate students in our lab on the use and maintenance of our computing hardware. Providing reference material and documentation is part of that responsibility. 

Dr. Donald B. Kinghorn


%\closing{Many thanks}
