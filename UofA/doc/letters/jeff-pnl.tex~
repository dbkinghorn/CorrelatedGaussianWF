\opening{Hi Jeff}

Greetings from sunny Tucson \ldots we have meet a couple of times \ldots
I received my PhD. from WSU in 95 \ldots Ron Poshusta was my advisor.
Hope everything is going well for you in Richland. Looks like 
you all have been busy \ldots

I'm at the University of Arizona working with Ludwik Adamowicz
in the theoretical and computational chemistry group. I'm still 
working mostly on non-adiabatic calculations with correlated basis
sets \ldots fun calculations \ldots 

I've just put together a prototype Linux ``Beowulf'' cluster for the group
and am working on parallel versions,(MPI and PVM) of my energy 
optimization codes.
I'll probably work on a parallel version of our multi-reference coupled
cluster code too.
 
We are planning on building a 48+ processor cluster and would like to
try NWChem. I would like a copy of the source tree if possible. I'll 
see if I can optimize some of the code for this architecture. 
  

\closing{My warmest regards}
